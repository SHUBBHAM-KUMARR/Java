java is a statically typed language here we have to declare the type of data before its execution.Like JavaScript , Java doesnot recognized the type of dat whether its an integer ,float ,string,boolean and others

--syntax
type variableName = value;
example
int x = 5; // integer
string name = "shubham"//stirng
 bool x = true ;//boolean
